# ðŸ“˜ LeetCode Daily Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems â€” **one problem a day**.  
The goal is to build **consistency, problem-solving skills, and mastery in data structures & algorithms**.  

---

## ðŸ›  Languages / Tools
- **C++** (primary language for now)
- LeetCode Online Judge  
- **VS Code** for local testing  

---

## ðŸ”– Goals
- [ ] Solve **1 problem/day**
- [ ] Cover **all problem patterns** (arrays, strings, hashmaps, linked lists, DP, graphs, etc.)
- [ ] Track progress with clear notes
- [ ] Revisit and optimize previous solutions

---

## ðŸš€ Motivation
> *Consistency beats intensity.*  
> One problem a day may look small, but over a year thatâ€™s **365 problems solved!**
